# Analyzing an experiment on involuntary attention using **```brms```**

![Bayes @ Lund 2018](media/BayesAtLund2018_avatar.jpg)

Description, analysis, and preliminary results of an experiment investigating involuntary attentional orienting using a temporal order judgment procedure. Analysis was done using the *R* package `brms`.

This was my first attempt at creating a slide deck in *RStudio* using the *R* package `xaringan`.
